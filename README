Another crash analysis and triage tool for American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) results

Installation:
0. Install AFL (to your $PATH)
1. Install exploitable gdb script if you want to use it
2. Compile binaries (one plain, one ASAN, one instrumented is recommended) if you haven't already (see test-cases folder for examples)
3. Start with reading AflCrashAnalyzer.py and configure the CrashAnalysisConfig object in there (examples included)
4. Start AflCrashAnalyzer.py with python 2.7

Bugs and todo's:
- see "TODO" in code

License:
- GPL version 3

Features for now:
- crash input file deduplication (on filesize + md5)
- running binary with each crash input file and divide the input file into folders for each signal
- For crash input files that create signals you are interested in you can:
  - Run the binary and put stdout/stderr into a .txt file next to the crash input file
    - The same for ASAN enabled binaries
    - Run the binary with gdb in batch mode and a configurable gdb script (for example including the "exploitable" gdb script)
